So friends today is the last lecture of the basic course and today we will just summarize whatever we learnt till now.


- **[Day 1](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-1-introduction-and-installation-ee8)** We learnt what is Python, installed Python and wrote our very first hello world program. We also understood why Python is advantageous to other languages like C and Java.

- **[Day 2](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-2-statements-comments-and-indentation-5b71)** We learnt about Python statement types like assignments, expressions, declarations. We learnt how comments are written and the need of indentation. We then solved a few practice programs. 

- **[Day 3](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-3-operators-and-if-elif-else-51cc)** We covered logical, relational, assignment and arithmetic operators, saw how they work. Then we understood the if-else syntax and solved a few problems on that.

- **[Day 4](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-4-the-for-loop-40m8)** We learnt the For Loop in Python, how it differed from C, and solved some questions related to it. 

- **[Day 5](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-5-summary-of-the-week-and-interview-questions-37m0)** After quickly summarizing the week's learnings, we solved some questions which are asked in technical interviews.

- **[Day 6](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-6-the-while-loop-and-more-questions-k23)** We learnt about the while loop, checked the meaning behind `while-else` and solved questions related to it.

- **[Day 7](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-7-exercises-and-coding-challenges-2l2b)** We solved some more exciting questions on the for and while loop, and an coding challenge.

- **[Day 8](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-8-unicode-in-python-4pdc)** We learnt about Unicode in Python and solved questions. We learnt the use of `ord()` and `chr()` methods. the `ord` method returns the unicode of the charater while `chr()` returns the character.

- **[Day 9](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-9-summary-of-the-week-and-exercises-ji6)** After summarizing the week's learnings, we practiced everything related to it.

- **[Day 10](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-10-lists-in-python-1hcb)** We learnt about lists in Python, and various list functions like popping, appending, copying and much more. We then used these functions for creating a program for dynamic generation of lists.

- **[Day 11](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-11-multidimensional-lists-and-tuples-3bfl)** We learnt about multidimensional lists, dynamic generation of multidimensional lists and had an introduction to tuples. We learnt that tuples were non mutable lists which cannot be changed or altered in anyway after they are hardcoded.

- **[Day 12](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-12-basic-algorithms-1edc)** We used lists to make algorithms like bubble sorting, binary searching and sequential searching.

- **[Day 13](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-13-summary-of-the-week-and-stack-implementation-1b56)** We learnt how to implement stack in Python and summarized the week. Stacks and queues can be easily implemented in Python using lists and some cleaver use of it's inbuilt functions.

- **[Day 14](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-14-basic-exception-and-error-handling-using-try-except-5f38)** we covered the `try` `catch` statements, and basic exception handling. Advanced exception handling and types of exceptions, user defined exceptions is for later.

- **[Day 15](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-15-more-about-try-except-1nmj)** We solved some creative questions based on `try` `catch` and learnt about nesting them. We also saw one really challenging question related to `try` `except` [here](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-15-more-about-try-except-1nmj).

- **[Day 16](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-16-fractal-lists-and-other-questions-1ca6)** We solved more questions on lists now with the added power of `try` `except`. We covered questions like fractal lists, alphabetical order of lists and reversing lists.

- **[Day 17](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-17-summary-of-the-week-and-insertion-sort-4bi0)** We learnt how to implement insertion sort in Python.

- **[Day 18](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-18-dictionaries-in-python-30af)** We learnt about dictionaries. We checked out one example which covered many inbuilt functions related to dictionaries.

- **[Day 19](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-19-practicing-dictionary-exercises-1723)** We practiced a few questions on dictionaries and had quite a thorough practice of dictionaries in Python. We did programs to fuse two separate lists to a single dictionary, paired out even numbers and made fancy dictionaries using for loops.

- **[Day 20](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-20-hashtables-via-dictionaries-3nf1)** We learnt about hashtables and how to create them using dictionaries. We tried out simple and chained hashtables and worked out information retrieval using them.

- **[Day 21](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-21-summary-of-the-week-and-dictionary-exercises-391e)** This lecture was devoted to solving exercises related to dictionaries.

- **[Day 22](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-22-string-methods-part-1-9j8)** We covered string methods for effects like case changing, word manipulations, etc.

- **[Day 23](https://dev.to/aatmaj/day-23-fi9)** We leant about the string methods which are required for GUI.

- **[Day 24](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-basic-course-day-24-string-methods-part-3-1mg9)**- We finished off with string functions
