### Summary of the week

#### [Day 9, Complex numbers part 1](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-9-complex-numbers-part-1-2pkh)

In this part we explored the `cmath` module. The `cmath` module in Python s a built in module which contains mathematical functions related to operations of complex numbers. Complex numbers can be created in the following manner `z= complex(x,y)` `z.real` and `z.imaginary` provide us with the real and imaginary parts.

We also saw how easily we can operate complex numbers in Python. We can do operations like addition, product and raising to a power, simply with the use of operators. Unlike other languages, we do not require any other functions for these simple operations.

#### [Day 10, Complex numbers part 2](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-10-complex-numbers-part-2-48jh)

This part was reserved for `cmath` module functions. We covered functions like `phase()` and `polar()` which are frequently used while operating with complex numbers. After that, we saw how we can use the methods in the `cmath` library for more complicated mathematical operations. Entire list of functions with documentation can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html)

Complex numbers are useful in many branches of programming. We checked out a few in this part. For those who are not comfortable with the use of complex numbers might like [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=T647CGsuOVU%3Cbr%3E%0A)

#### [Day 11, Random numbers](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-11-random-numbers-5cnj)

In this part we focused on the Python `random` module. Just like the math and cmath modules, the 'random' module is built in into Python, so we do not need to take any extra efforts to download or install it. We saw how to cover complex numbers in the range 0-1 by using the `random()` method. The `randint()` method generates a integer between a given range of numbers. We also covered methods to return a list of random numbers.

Thank you ! That was all for this week 👍 Meet you next Tuesday 🤠
