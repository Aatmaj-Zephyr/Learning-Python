- [Day 34](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-34-toplevel-panedwindow-and-message-widgets-44l6) We covered three widgets, top-level, paned window and the message widget. The toplevel widget is used to represent some extra information, pop-up, or the group of widgets on the new window. The toplevel windows have the title bars, borders, and other window decorations. The Paned Window widget acts like a Container widget for holding many widgets in place. The message widget is similar to the label widget and is used to display messages.

- [Day 35](https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-35-messagebox-widget-19c8) We covered the message-box widget. The message-box widget is used to to display popup messages with different signs and symbols for specific instances of messages like errors or warnings. It can also be used to ask question to user in a yes/no format.
