### Summary of the week

This week we learnt about Tkinter. We also checked out the various widgets supported by Tkinter. Today let us finish of the remaining widgets.

### Types of widgets in Tkinter continued..........

- menu
  The Menu widget is used to create various types of menus in the python application. The types of menus include top level, pull down, and pop up

- message
  The message widget is used to display a message in the application. It looks similar to the label widget.

- Toplevel
  This widget is used to make a pop-up like effect. It creates another window. It can be used to represent some extra info. This window is managed internally by the system. (Window manager in Windows)

In this program, clicking on the open buttons activates the Toplevel widgets and creates another blank window.

Closing the main application window closes all windows.

- spinbox
  Spinbox is a less attractive version of the slider widget. Again, It is useful over the Entry widget when the user is forced to select only one value from the given range of values.

We can also type in the spinbox.

- panelWindow
  The PanedWindow widget is a resizable frame widget. It contains one or more child widgets arranged horizontally or vertically. Unlike the frame widget, child widgets can be resized by the user, by moving the separator lines. These separator lines are called as sashes.

  LabelFrame is also a type of frame, but we can add borders to the widgets.

- MessageBox
  The messagebox module is used to display the message boxes in the python applications.
  It is a kind of alert in the application.
